%description
BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate genomic variant calls in the
Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart (BCF). All commands work
transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.

(This BCFtools includes the polysomy subcommand, which is implemented using
the GNU Scientific Library. Hence this package is licensed according to the
GNU General Public License, rather than the MIT license used when BCFtools
is built without the polysomy subcommand.)
